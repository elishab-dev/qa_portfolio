# QA Portfolio

This repository demonstrates my skills in manual testing of web applications. It includes a test suite, bug reports, and functional decompositions.

## Contents

### PetStore App

- [PetStore App - Registration Form Test Suite](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_keJ7zs5UoSRTah9BZcTSJJua8M4bnKHVYnubihGDw0/edit?usp=sharing)

In this test suite, I designed test cases for both positive and negative scenarios to ensure coverage of a critical registration functionality.
I practiced input validation testing for User ID, Email, and Password fields, including format and uniqueness checks. I learned to prioritize test cases based on criticality and potential user impact.

- [PetStore App - Functional Bug Reports (Shopping Cart & Checkout)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EigpIxupNU18S7K4UDuYz1GX6LShy381sM8yhbzZjC4/edit?usp=sharing)

I made 3 bug reports in which I identified functional issues that impact user experience, such as incorrect error messages and invalid data handling.
The hardest thing for me was reproducing bugs step by step to ensure clear and reproducible reports.
I developed skills in assessing severity and priority, understanding the potential impact on UX and business processes.

- [PetStore App - Exploratory Testing Findings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18SJ5uMGvnD0CuPCM1hkVkRjm9dFjcexrf4dyPHmjZKg/edit?usp=sharing)

In this task, I practiced the application of the WWW rule (What, Where, When) to report bugs clearly and systematically, improving reproducibility for developers.
I learnt prioritizing and categorizing issues based on severity, potential impact, and urgency.

### Conduit App

- [Conduit App - Functional Decomposition (Logged-Out User)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPvxr2dzzmAn2yAhkadfc7S_Vn3xtyywmb0_SDk7S_Q/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Conduit App - Functional Decomposition (Logged-In User)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tx_3JpjDfgXzOWtnCXjEZB_YTtB-rcGDJ3F_8-vQNW4/edit?usp=sharing)

This task helped me with identifying critical user flows.
I applied systematic hierarchy and structured UI elements and interactions for comprehensive test coverage.

### Trello App

- [Trello QA Test - UI Bug Reports](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14fWCAxM4RTDbZq4wyCTqCBCz9Exj2RDZnHYH1-x8q_M/edit?usp=sharing)

I practiced detecting visual inconsistency affecting UX.
